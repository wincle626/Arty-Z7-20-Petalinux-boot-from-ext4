small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the
utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities
in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU
cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected
functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox
provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or embedded
system.

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the
utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities
in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU
cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected
functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox
provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or embedded
system.  This package contains ELF symbols and related sources for
debugging purposes.

Description:
D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one
another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate
process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a \"single
instance\" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on
demand when their services are needed.  This package contains static
libraries for software development.

Description:
D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one
another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate
process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a \"single
instance\" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on
demand when their services are needed.

Description:
Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which does
not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate fonts within
the system and select them according to requirements specified by
applications. Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose
a particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and rasterize
fonts.  This package contains ELF symbols and related sources for debugging

Description:
Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-
source files of a program from the program's source files.  Make gets its
knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the makefile,
which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other
files.  This package contains language translation files for the vi locale.
