# Arty-Z7-20-Petalinux-boot-from-ext4
This repo is created from standard Petalinux 2016.2 with Arty Z7 BSP. 
Different from the official one, this Petalinux does not build rootfs and boot from mmcblk0p2 with ext4 format. 
This allow user to have more flexibility of development. 
All built files are under ......./image/linux folder.
